Neophyte's Repository Attempt 

	Hi, my name is Lindsay. One can also address me as Linz, Bae, or BaexBae. 
I am allergic to cats, dogs, trees, grass, pollen, and dust. 
However, recently I was convinced to adopt a stray 5 month-old kitten who turns out to be pregnant with 3 kittens. 
Now I am suddenly not only a cat-mom, but also cat-grandmother. 
I love learning new skills unconventually. Whether it be from learning how to care/ help birth kittens to learning on how to become a web developer. 
I am excited for this new chapter of my life and dream about the community I get to work with.
